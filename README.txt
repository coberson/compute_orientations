These mathematica files make it possible to compute and show the local orientation vector field of a 3D image. 
The issuing vector field can be seen as a description of the local orientation of a 3D image and can be used to describe the orientation of objects in such an image.
It was written in 2012, during my time at the Workgroup Imaging, University of Muenster, as part of a joint project with Christoph Brune and Hendrik Dirks.
Needs function 'fspecial3' (Damien Garcia, in '~/matlab').
Needs function 'showVectorfield3D(f,v1,v2)' (Hendrik Dirks, in '~/matlab') for 3D representation of the horizontal layers.
Needs my function 'ellipsoid_gf' for one of the examples.
